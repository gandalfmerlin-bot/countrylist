# countrylist-example

In this repo you'll find explaination and examples for country list for the [Discord Bot](https://discord.gg/fzGhChcvdK). 

**Currently** it's not possible to create them manually. If want to add a List read this. Duplicates will be rejceted so make sure your List is not in [`countrylists/`](./countrylists) or see here.

## How to add your CountryList

### What do I need?

- A GitHub Account
- Your Server Id (See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/1h1a3xl/comment/lz9xggf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) how to get it)

### New List

1. Create a Branch. Use this name pattern: `<what you want to do>/<countrylists-name>`
    > Example: `new-countrylist\road-to-56` or `add-country\tfb`

2. Create a new file (`<countrylist-name>.json`) in `/countrylists`

3. Paste or write your countrylist which follows [`example.json`](./example.json). If you need help help see [#Explaination]

4. Commit your changes

5. Create a PR (`your branch` > `main`). Describe your Country List (Is it an improvement or for a mod? etc.)

6. Wait for the runner to check your submission. If it's fails make adjustments to your file. You can click on Details to find out why the check fails.
    
    > *The PR will be rejected if the review is unsuccessful.*

7. Wait for me ([danielvici123](https://github.com/danielvici)) to answer your PR. It will be merged once its in the Database.

### Update a List

It's basically the same, but instead of creating a new file, you update the old one.
